# nutcracker 
A match-3 and block-breaking inspired puzzle game created with Lua and LOVE, where players complete each level by appropriately matching enough nuts (acorns, walnuts, and peanuts are progressively cracked open when matched; from husk to shell to fruit, etc. For example, brown acorns may be matched with brown acorns, and each cracks upon matching to become one of multiple different inner varieties). Levels get increasingly difficult as they introduce new sprites and bonuses. High scores can be saved under multiple users.
I designed all backgrounds, sprites, interfaces, and animations using Adobe Suite.
