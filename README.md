# Nutcracker 

A match-3 and block-breaking inspired puzzle game created with Lua and LÃ–VE, where players complete each level by appropriately matching enough items (nuts are progressively cracked open when matched: from husk to shell to fruit, etc. For example, brown acorns may be matched with brown acorns, and each cracks upon matching to become one of multiple different inner layers, which must then be matched with eother matching inner layers). 

Levels get increasingly difficult and complex as new sprites, bonuses, and special features are introduced. High scores can be saved under multiple users.

I designed all backgrounds, sprites, interfaces, and animations using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
